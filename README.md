# Roll-A-Ball
A Unity C# Game Project that I built for the UniVerse Bootcamp 'Intro to Unity and C# Programming', https://www.tryuniverse.com/. Assignments came from the Unity 'Create with Code' and 'Beginner Scripting' training. Basic components are given to fix, utilize, and update. Liberty was given to tweak as desire. Games are not mobile-ready.

Links to play the project can be found at https://www.teamgeorgecloud.com/#projects or at https://play.unity.com/u/Gr3y8u5h.
